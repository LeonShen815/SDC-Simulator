# SDC-Simulator
Our project deals with an autonomous car that travels on a certain route with multiple obstacles. The project is based on distributed computing using GPUs in Linux systems , based on 'Parallel Algorithms for Real-time Motion Planning' by Matthew McNaughton and 'State Lattice-based Motion Planning for Autonomous On-Road Driving' by Shuiying Wang.
