## About the project:

Our project deals with an autonomous car that travels on a certain route with multiple obstacles. The project is based on distributed computing using GPUs in Linux systems , based on 'Parallel Algorithms for Real-time Motion Planning' by Matthew McNaughton and 'State Lattice-based Motion Planning for Autonomous On-Road Driving' by Shuiying Wang.


## Development setup

Dash is designed to run completely offline on the file:// protocol with no local server needed to serve resources. However, if any changes are made, Webpack is used to rebuild the sources into separate app and worker distributions. Development dependencies are downloaded with npm.

After making changes, build the project with:

npm run build

Changes can be watched and rebuilt automatically using:

npm run watch
